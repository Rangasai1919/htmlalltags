                <b><u>Konidela Pawan Kalyan</u></b>  (born 2 September 1971)[2] is an Indian politician, actor and philanthropist, serving as the 10th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forests, Science and Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh and an MLA representing the Pitapuram constituency.[3] He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.

                As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He commands an enormous fanbase across the Telugu states, widely regarded as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following."[7] He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[8][13] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.
                
                Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.[4][6] In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.[17] Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.[19] He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh.

                Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate.[21] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[22] He practices various martial arts, which he regularly showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He is known as "Power Star" among his fans and the media.[23] Kalyan is known for his extensive philanthropic efforts, across various social causes including orphan welfare, elderly care, disaster relief, healthcare, education, farmer welfare, soldier welfare, parasports, arts, literature, and temple support.[24] He has provided financial support to both individuals in need and organizations. He founded the charity Common Man Protection Force in 2007.

                n March 2014, Pawan Kalyan founded the Janasena Party (JSP). Although he chose not to contest the 2014 elections, his support and campaigns were pivotal in securing victory for the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh.[28] He later brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam,[29] and led protests against forced land acquisition,[26] and illegal mining in reserved forests.[30] In 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat with around 6% of the vote. Following this, Kalyan and JSP focused on issues like farmer welfare, transparent governance, illegal sand mining, women's safety, and land encroachment.

                Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[50] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[51] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001).[

                In November 1998, there were reports of Kalyan collaborating with Malayalam director Fazil for a project to be produced by G. V. G. Raju, who had earlier produced Tholi Prema.[54] However, his next film turned out to be Thammudu, where he played the role of a kickboxer. Released in July 1999, Thammudu was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad.[55] The film collected a distributor share of ₹9.25–9.46 crore, emerging as a blockbuster and generating a profit of over ₹4 crores for buyers.[56][57] It became the second-highest-grossing film in the Nizam region after Choodalani Vundi (1998).[57] Kalyan's performance as a youth competing in a kickboxing contest was widely acclaimed.[55] The film's success led to it being remade in Tamil as Badri (2001), in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and in Bengali as Champion

                Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote, directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai.[77] Produced by Allu Aravind with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment.[78] Johnny had the highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at the time[79] and was released with over 250 prints worldwide.[80][81] Kalyan's clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed many fans.[82] Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action choreography.[83][84] Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular.[85] It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India

Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh.[88] These pants later became a trend among the youth.[85][82] Balu was the first Telugu film to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box office.
